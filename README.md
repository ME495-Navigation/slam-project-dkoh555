# Package List
This repository consists of several ROS packages
- `nusim ` - Provides a simulated robot environment for the turtlebot
- `nuturtle_control` -  Enables control of the turtlebot in real life or simulation
- `nuturtle_description` - Visualizes a single or multiple turtlebots in rviz
- `turtlelib` - Enables performing 2D rigid body transformations and other functionality

# HW2
Video submission for Physical Testing:

The final odom position was x: 0.064997, y: -0.1335737

## Issue: Catch_ros2
Whilst attempting to run integration tests, I will always receive the 'result_file' does not exist error.
Additionally, attempting to run the integration runs ghost nodes that only exit when shut down.

# HW4
Really sorry but with everything going on this quarter, I didn't have a chance to properly do this task.

(At the beginning of next quarter I will complete this for my own learning and portfolio)
